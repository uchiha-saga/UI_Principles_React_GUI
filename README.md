# CS 4470 / 6456 Principles of UI - React GUI Workshop

This is the second workshop of our class which gives an overview of the basics of ReactJS GUI.

## About this project

This is a basic GUI on how to create a form, which is adapted from the Figma prototype which was done in class.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- Node.js (if applicable)
- HTML & CSS

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uchiha-saga/UI_Principles_React_GUI.git

2. Install node from this website  https://nodejs.org
   Download the LTS version
   Check if you have it installed in your system by this command
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

3. If you are creating the React project from scratch, then you can create the react workspace by this command:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app form-builder
   ```

   Then navigate to the "form-builder" folder
   ```bash
   cd form-builder
   ```
   
   Then install npm
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Then run the project
   ```bash
   npm run
   ```
   
4. Or you can use Vite + ReactJS:
  ```bash
  npm create vite
  ```

  It will ask you to create the folder name, let us say "form-builder"

  Then navigate to the "form-builder" folder
  ```bash
  cd form-builder
  ```
   
  Then install npm
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

  Then run the project
  ```bash
  npm run dev 
  ```
